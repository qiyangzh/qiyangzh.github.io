I am a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, School of Education. I am currently working as a research assistant at Center for Research and Reform in Education with my advisor Dr. Robert Slavin. Before coming to Johns Hopkins, I graduated with a master's degree in Education Policy from the Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania. I also hold dual Bachelor's degrees in Economics and Industrial Systems Engineering (with Honors and Distinction) from the National University of Singapore.
