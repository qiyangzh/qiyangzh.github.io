description: "The analysis used data from Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Matching methodologies controlled for confounding variables including age, sex, living sites, access to tap water and financial support. Illiteracy was found to have a significant impact on physical health, exercise habits, anxiety, loneliness and happiness. On average, illiteracy decreased physical health by 19.9%, decreased exercise habits by 7%, increased anxiety by 11.56%, increased loneliness by 17.6% and decreased happiness by 11.3%. Findings confirm the past literature in which illiteracy has been found to be adversely associated with physical and mental health. The analysis uniquely found that illiteracy had a higher cost on mental health as compared to physical health for elderly people in China."

This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps. For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:

- Don’t mandate DevOps. Give employees the chance to master their discipline with examples to set and follow.
- Favor deep end-to-end accomplishments over broad but incremental steps forward. Focus on taking the right teams far before encouraging broad adoption.
- Centralize the platforms and tools that your teams shouldn’t be thinking about. Provide foundational services/commodities and let teams stay on purpose.
- Incorporate contributions from everyone; don’t stifle autonomy. Stay open to new ways of working.
- Challenge security policies, but respect intentions. Find new ways to enforce concerns without abandoning precaution.
